Some joke game, read this file

It started with someone I know having a habit of typing "huehue" for some reason, then someone else I know using AI to create a game of it.

I then decided to create my own huehue game without AI because I don't really like generative AI :)

The reason I am saying this is because I looked it up and huehue means elderly in Brazilian from what I can tell, so this is no means of referencing Brazil or anything related to it. This is purely a coincidence, I do not mean to offend any Brazilians.
